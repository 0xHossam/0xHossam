## 0xHossam | Hossam Ehab

I focus on red teaming, malware research, and adversary simulation, conducting internal and external red team engagements and internal network pen-test across on-prem/cloud envs. I develop offensive security tools also analyzing threat actor tactics, and provide actionable mitigation strategies. I am dedicated to growing as a skilled red team operator!
