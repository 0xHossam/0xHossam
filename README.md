I am passionate about red teaming, malware research, adversary simulation and windows security research. My expertise spans internal and external red team operations, active directory & network security, and breaching enterprise environments by architecting modern attack paths. I’m good at writing codes with C/C++, Python, and Assembly. I develop innovative tools and techniques to enhance offensive security capabilities (OST) and dicated to growing as a skilled red teamer :)
